# PyTesseract-OCR-Experimentation

---

In order to run this locally, you need the official tesseract-ocr in your PATH.

You can follow your specific OS installation process here:

https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html

For the system I used (MacOS M2), all I had to do was:

```
brew install tesseract
```
